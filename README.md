# Ubuntu 19.10 Dotfiles

My personal set-up scripts and config. I initially wrote about these in this [accompanying article](https://victoria.dev/verbose/how-to-set-up-a-fresh-ubuntu-desktop-using-only-dotfiles-and-bash-scripts/).

The `master` branch is for what I'm currently running: [Kubuntu 19.10](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EoanErmine/ReleaseNotes/Kubuntu) with KDE Plasma 5.18.

The `ubuntu` branch is intended for Ubuntu running GNOME Desktop. It was last used by me on [Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EoanErmine/ReleaseNotes).

## My current themes

- Visual Studio Code: [Kabukichō](https://github.com/victoriadrake/kabukicho-vscode)
- Plasma theme: [Rounded](https://store.kde.org/p/1355066/)

## Add a simple backup

I use a cron job to back up to an AWS S3 bucket [and blogged about it](https://victoria.dev/blog/a-cron-job-that-could-save-you-from-a-ransomware-attack/).
